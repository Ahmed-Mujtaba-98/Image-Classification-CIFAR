# üèùÔ∏è IMAGE CLASSIFICATION USING PYTORCH üî•Ô∏è - CIFAR DATASET

**About CIFAR10**

The CIFAR-10 dataset is a collection of images commonly used to train machine learning and computer vision algorithms. It is one of the most widely used datasets for machine learning research. The dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. The 10 different classes represent airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. There are 6,000 images of each class.

**About CIFAR100**

The CIFAR-100 dataset is a collection of 60,000 32x32 color images in 100 different classes. Each class contains 600 images, with 500 images for training and 100 images for testing. The 100 classes are divided into 20 superclasses. For each image, there are two labels: a "fine" label indicating the specific class, and a "coarse" label indicating the superclass. The dataset was introduced by Krizhevsky et al., and is widely used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

## üå¥Ô∏è Model Training
To starting training the models, run the below command,

```
python train.py --epochs 10 --dataset cifar10 --model Net
```

```
python train.py --epochs 10 --dataset cifar10 --model Net --save_model
```

To resume training from saved checkpoint, run the below command,

```
python train.py --epochs 10 --dataset cifar10 --model Net --resume
```
